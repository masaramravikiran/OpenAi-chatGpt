# OpenAI ChatGPT Project  

## Overview  

This project demonstrates [briefly describe the purpose of your project - e.g., a simple interface to interact with the OpenAI ChatGPT model, a tool for analyzing ChatGPT responses, etc.].  It utilizes the OpenAI API to [mention key functionalities, e.g., send prompts, receive responses, manage conversation history].  

## Features  

*   [List the key features of your project. Be specific. Examples:]  
    *   Send text prompts to the ChatGPT model.  
    *   Display responses in a user-friendly format.  
    *   Maintain a conversation history.  
    *   Allow customization of API parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.).  
    *   [Add any other relevant features]  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

*   An OpenAI API key.  You can obtain one from [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  
*   [List any software dependencies, e.g., Python 3.7+,  Node.js 14+, specific libraries/packages]  
    *   Example: Python 3.8 or higher  
    *   Example: `pip install openai`  

### Installation  

1.  Clone the repository:  
    ```bash  
    git clone [your repository URL]  
    cd [your project directory]  
    ```  
2.  Install dependencies (if any):  
    ```bash  
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Or your project's specific installation command  
    ```  
3.  Set up your OpenAI API key:  
    *   Option 1: Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.  
        ```bash  
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"  
        ```  
    *   Option 2:  [If your project uses a configuration file, explain how to add the API key there.  For example:] Add your API key to the `config.ini` file.  

### Usage  

1.  Run the main script:  
    ```bash  
    python main.py  # Or the appropriate command to start your project  
    ```  
2.  [Explain how to interact with your project.  Provide examples. For example:]  Enter your prompt in the input field and press Enter to send it to ChatGPT.  The response will be displayed below.  

## Configuration  

[Explain any configurable parameters and how to modify them. For example:]  

*   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the responses.  Higher values (e.g., 1.0) produce more random responses, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make them more deterministic.  
*   `max_tokens`:  The maximum number of tokens in the generated response.  

These parameters can be adjusted in the `config.ini` file.
